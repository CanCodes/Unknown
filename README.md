# Unknown Bot!

Two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their players first. Team Captains give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin.

If you want to hang out with us and test the bot, here is the invite link to our Discor Server: https://discord.gg/WA3Zzrz

Inspired by the good old board game: [Codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames)
